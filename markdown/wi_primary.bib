  abstract = {Nearest-neighbor matching is a popular nonparametric tool to create balance between treatment and control groups in observational studies. As a preprocessing step before regression, matching reduces the dependence on parametric modeling assumptions. In current empirical practice, however, the matching step is often ignored in the calculation of standard errors and confidence intervals. In this article, we show that ignoring the matching step results in asymptotically valid standard errors if matching is done without replacement and the regression model is correctly specified relative to the population regression function of the outcome variable on the treatment variable and all the covariates used for matching. However, standard errors that ignore the matching step are not valid if matching is conducted with replacement or, more crucially, if the second step regression model is misspecified in the sense indicated above. Moreover, correct specification of the regression model is not required for consistent estimation of treatment effects with matched data. We show that two easily implementable alternatives produce approximations to the distribution of the post-matching estimator that are robust to misspecification. A simulation study and an empirical example demonstrate the empirical relevance of our results.},

  abstract = {Could changing the locations of polling places affect the outcome of an election by increasing the costs of voting for some and decreasing them for others? The consolidation of voting precincts in Los Angeles County during California's 2003 gubernatorial recall election provides a natural experiment for studying how changing polling places influences voter turnout. Overall turnout decreased by a substantial 1.85 percentage points: A drop in polling place turnout of 3.03 percentage points was partially offset by an increase in absentee voting of 1.18 percentage points. Both transportation and search costs caused these changes. Although there is no evidence that the Los Angeles Registrar of Voters changed more polling locations for those registered with one party than for those registered with another, the changing of polling places still had a small partisan effect because those registered as Democrats were more sensitive to changes in costs than those registered as Republicans. The effects were small enough to allay worries about significant electoral consequences in this instance (e.g., the partisan effect might be decisive in only about one in two hundred contested House elections), but large enough to make it possible for someone to affect outcomes by more extensive manipulation of polling place locations.},

Specifically, I determine the extent to which alternative voting methods such as unrestricted absentee voting, in-person early voting, election-day registration, and motor vehicle and mail registration actually increase turnout and attract participants to the electoral arena by making voting more convenient and reducing the “costs” of participation. In doing so, voter turnout is examined in federal elections across the 50 states and over the time period 1972-2002. Apooled cross-sectional time-series model with fixed effects is used to explore the aggregate, state-level data. Overall, the results reveal the relative weakness of the structural-legal theory with regard to explaining electoral participation and show that voter turnout in U.S. elections may be less about convenience and costs than expected.},

Specifically, as of 2012, the entire state uses a vote-by-mail system, reducing the cost of voting. In addition, Washington adopted a top-two primary format in 2008, increasing the importance of primaries. Methods Using turnout data between 2000 and 2014, we examine the effect of vote-by-mail and the top-two primary format on voter turnout. Results We find that both of these policies have had a positive impact on voter turnout in Washington State primaries, raising turnout to the point where Washington's primary turnout exceeds the general election turnout in other states. Conclusions These results suggest that other states might consider vote-by-mail and/or a top-two primary format to increase voter participation.},

It is therefore difficult to establish whether spouses mobilize each other or tend to marry similar others. Here, we test the dependency hypothesis by examining voting behavior before and after the death of a spouse. We link nearly six million California voter records to Social Security death records and use both coarsened exact matching and multiple cohort comparison to estimate the effects of spousal loss. The results show that after turnout rates stabilize, widowed individuals vote nine percentage points fewer than they would had their spouse still been living; the results also suggest that this change may persist indefinitely.

The literature in political science has attempted to document whether the presence of an initiative can increase voter turnout. We study this question for an initiative that appeared on the ballot in 2008 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, using a natural experiment based on geography. This form of natural experiment exploits variation in geography where units in one geographic area receive a treatment whereas units in another area do not. When assignment to treatment via geographic location creates as-if random variation in treatment assignment, adjustment for baseline covariates is unnecessary. In many applications, however, some adjustment for baseline covariates may be necessary. As such, analysts may wish to combine identification strategies—using both spatial proximity and covariates. We propose a matching framework to incorporate information about both geographic proximity and observed covariates flexibly which allows us to minimize spatial distance while preserving balance on observed covariates. This framework is also applicable to regression discontinuity designs that are not based on geography. We find that the initiative on the ballot in Milwaukee does not appear to have increased turnout.},

Many electoral reform advocates predict that mail ballot elections will boost participation, basing their prediction on the high turnout rate among absentee voters and on the rise in voter turnout after Oregon switched to voting by mail. However, selection problems inherent to studies of absentee voters and Oregon give us important reasons to doubt whether their results would extend to more general applications of voting by mail. In this paper, we isolate the effects of voting in mail ballot elections by taking advantage of a natural experiment in which voters are assigned in a nearly random process to cast their ballots by mail. We use matching methods to ensure that, in our analysis, the demographic characteristics of these voters mirror those of polling-place voters who take part in the same elections. Drawing on data from a large sample of California counties in two general elections, we find that voting by mail does not deliver on the promise of greater participation in general elections. In fact, voters who are assigned to vote by mail turn out at lower rates than those who are sent to a polling place. Analysis of a sample of local special elections, by contrast, indicates that voting by mail can increase turnout in these otherwise low-participation contests.},

  abstract = {This paper conceives of residential segregation as a multidimensional phenomenon varying along five distinct axes of measurement: evenness, exposure, concentration, centralization, and clustering. Twenty indices of segregation are surveyed and related conceptually to one of the five dimensions. Using data from a large set of U.S. metropolitan areas, the indices are intercorrelated and factor analyzed. Orthogonal and oblique rotations produce pattern matrices consistent with the postulated dimensional structure. Based on the factor analyses and other information, one index was chosen to represent each of the five dimensions, and these selections were confirmed with a principal components analysis. The paper recommends adopting these indices as standard indicators in future studies of segregation.},

Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) and General Social Survey (GSS), we find that people who report excellent health are more likely to vote and more likely to identify with the Republican Party. Moreover, the effects of health on voter turnout and partisanship appear to have both developmental and contemporaneous components. Taken together, our findings suggest that health inequalities may have significant political consequences.},

This article uses voting record data from 20 election cycles, GIS-coded flood-depth data, and census data to examine the voting behavior of registered voters in New Orleans before and after Hurricane Katrina. We use a variety of statistical techniques, primarily propensity score matching methods, to examine how flooding affected mayoral turnout. We find that flooding decreased participation, but registered voters who experienced more than 6 ft of flooding were more likely to participate in the election than those who experienced less flooding. This finding confirms that increasing the cost of voting decreases turnout and suggests several mechanisms motivating an expressive component of voting behavior. Our results indicate there is a complex relationship between participation and the costs and benefits of turnout. Our findings about the characteristics of the voters who participated in the mayoral election provide insights into the scope of change for the political landscape of New Orleans.},

  abstract = {Previous election reforms designed to increase turnout have often made voting more convenient for frequent voters without significantly increasing turnout among infrequent voters. A recent innovation—Election Day vote centers—provides an alternative means of motivating electoral participation among infrequent voters. Election Day vote centers are nonprecinct-based locations for voting on Election Day. The sites are fewer in number than precinct-voting stations, centrally located to major population centers (rather than distributed among many residential locations), and rely on county-wide voter registration databases accessed by electronic voting machines. Voters in the voting jurisdiction (usually a county) are provided ballots appropriate to their voter registration address. It is thought that the use of voting centers on Election Day will increase voter turnout by reducing the cost and/or inconvenience associated with voting at traditional precinct locations. Since 2003 voters in Larimer County, CO have balloted at one of 32 vote centers. Precinct voting in Larimer ended in 2003. To test the efficacy of Election Day vote centers, we have collected individual vote histories on voters in Larimer and a control county (i.e., Weld, CO) that used precinct voting on Election Day for the years 1992–2004. We find significant evidence to support the hypothesis that Election Day vote centers increase voter turnout generally, and among infrequent voters in particular.},

  abstract = {The early outbreak of COVID-19 became associated with various “hot spots” in the United States, particularly in large cities. However, despite the widespread nature of the outbreak, much of what is known about the virus’ impact and clusters is understood either for individuals, or at the state level. There are likely to be underlying differences within states and counties that predict higher rates of the disease and can help policymakers to understand why certain communities have been harder hit. Neighborhoods are smaller spatial units where residents spend their time, particularly during a quarantine, but more importantly neighborhoods shape their social circles, movement, and identities, therefore differences across neighborhoods are likely to be reflected in counts of COVID-19, as well. Using data from the Louisiana Department of Health, our contribution is the first to analyze the case count through May 3, 2020 at the census tract level and its relationship to individual and geographic neighborhood characteristics. We find a particularly high association between race and COVID-19 cases, as high minority share neighborhoods show a positive association, robust to model specification and spatial autocorrelation. In addition, neighborhoods with lower rates of poverty and those with fewer residents over 70 have fewer cases. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of the findings for health professionals, policymakers, and individuals given the continuing importance of the neighborhood context.},
